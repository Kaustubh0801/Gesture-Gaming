# Gesture Gaming Using Machine Learning and Raspberry Pi

###This project combines machine learning techniques with hardware integration to create a gesture-based gaming system using a Raspberry Pi. The system allows users to interact with a game environment using hand gestures recognized by a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Servo motors and seven-segment displays are used to provide visual feedback and enhance the gaming experience.

Features
Recognize hand gestures using a CNN model trained on TensorFlow/Keras.
Control servo motors connected to a Raspberry Pi GPIO for physical feedback.
Display game scores or other information on two seven-segment displays.
Seamless integration of hardware components with the CNN model for real-time interaction.
Easily customizable and extensible for different gaming scenarios.
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi (Model 3B+ or later recommended)
Servo motors (3x)
Seven-segment displays (2x)
Jumper wires and breadboard for connections
Software Requirements
Raspbian OS installed on Raspberry Pi
Python 3.x with libraries: TensorFlow, RPi.GPIO, serial
Trained CNN model (saved in TensorFlow SavedModel format)
Installation
Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-gaming.git
Install required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow RPi.GPIO pyserial
Upload your trained CNN model to the models/ directory.

Usage
Connect the servo motors and seven-segment displays to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi according to the provided wiring diagram.

Run the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
cd gesture-gaming
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the gesture-based gaming system.

Configuration
Adjust GPIO pin numbers in the code if using different pins for servo motors or displays.
Fine-tune servo motor positions and display updates as needed for your specific gaming scenario.
